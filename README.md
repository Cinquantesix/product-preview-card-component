## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Node
### What I learned

For this challenge, I wanted to try the Sass way. Honestly, I think I need to try it in an other project because I only used some of the featured for this one. I also learn about how to add a specific image for a specific size (mobile or desktop, etc.). I don't think I have understand all this thing but I'm happy to discovered a new way to adapt some content for my next development  

### Continued development

For the next one, I thinl I really need to think about mobile first and a better way to use size and positioning. 

### Useful resources

- [HTML srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - An exemple for image size change between mediaqueries.
